        <h4> <em>About me:</em> </h4>
        </p>

        I am currently a student at San Leandro High School and will be an incoming junior. I was born in Berkeley, CA, but I have lived in San Leandro for most of my life. I have 3 siblings, 2 older sisters and a younger brother, and I also have a pet dog and turtle, while my parents are both proud immigrants from Mexico. I am a student in the Social Justice Academy (SJA) at my high school, and social justice is something I am very passionate about. I definitely enjoy a variety of different genres of music, some of my favorite artists are BTS, Brockhampton, The Internet and Loona.

        <h4> <em>What I Like:</em> </h4>
        <div>
        Astrology, I love to read about it and educate myself. It is honestly probably not real, but it is okay. Astronomy is cool too, I guess.
